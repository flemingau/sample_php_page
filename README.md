Summary

This sample code is written in PHP. It's purpose is to dynamically create a HTML page with the proper HEAD tags and input form elements.

This code was created as a submisson for a code challenge that originally contained errors that needed to be identified and fixed.  All the errors within the form_input.php file have been fixed with accompanying comments prepended with the word "FIX:" next to them.  The original file can be found as form_input.original.php  I have also provided comments for each function I've created within each new page.
